This is the Place Manager App in iOS using Core Data as the underlying model. Upon first run, places.json is converted to core data. Each initial run uses Core Data to persist places. 

The app open with a table view of places. To view or edit the details of a place, select the accessory button (information) on a row. To view the circle distance between two places, simply select two palces. To add a new place, press the + button on the tool bar. To delete a place, press the edit button on the tool bar and press of delete button on the row you'd like to remove. Alternatively you can swipe left on the row to delete a place.
